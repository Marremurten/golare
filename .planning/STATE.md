## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key patterns established in v1:
- Database-first state, NOT sessions
- All outbound group messages through MessageQueue.send()
- Handler modules as Composer instances via bot.use()
- Template fallbacks on all AI paths
- Tiered AI models (gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4.1-nano)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- In-memory Maps for Sista Chansen/whisper state lost on restart (v1 trade-off, revisit if problematic)
- Global mutable botRef for scheduler access (revisit if architecture evolves)
